# Integrating Network Devices
## Network Types

#### **1.1 Local Area Network (LAN)**
- **Definition**: A network where devices are connected within the same broadcast domain.
- **Characteristics**: Devices can ping each other and communicate within the same local area, typically within a single building or office.

#### **1.2 Wide Area Network (WAN)**
- **Definition**: A network that connects multiple LANs across different locations.
- **Characteristics**: Requires a router to connect LANs and extend the network over large distances.

#### **1.3 Campus Area Network (CAN)**
- **Definition**: A network that connects multiple LANs within a campus or a large building complex.
- **Characteristics**: Interconnects multiple LANs within a larger geographic area, like a university or business campus.

#### **1.4 Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)**
- **Definition**: A network that spans a metropolitan area, such as a city.
- **Characteristics**: Connects various buildings or sites within a city or metropolitan area.

#### **1.5 Internet**
- **Definition**: The global network that connects multiple cities and countries.
- **Characteristics**: The largest network, connecting cities and countries worldwide.

#### **1.6 Intranet**
- **Definition**: A private network within an organization.
- **Characteristics**: Uses similar technology to the internet but is restricted to internal use.
### **2. Wireless Networks**

#### **2.1 Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN)**
- **Definition**: A wireless network where devices connect via wireless access points within the same broadcast domain.
- **Characteristics**: Devices can communicate with each other if connected to the same SSID and switch. Adding more access points or SSIDs doesnâ€™t change the WLAN if no routers are used.

#### **2.2 Personal Area Network (PAN)**
- **Definition**: A network for connecting devices over short distances using technologies like Bluetooth.
- **Characteristics**: Used for direct communication between a small number of devices, typically for personal use.


These categories cover the basic types of networks and their characteristics, clarifying how they differ based on their scope and connectivity.
