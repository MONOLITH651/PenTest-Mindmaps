# Installation of Physical Network
## Introduction to Structured Cabling
#### **Building an Ethernet Network:**
- **Basic Setup:**
  - The simplest form of an Ethernet network involves connecting a computer to a switch using an Ethernet cable. This creates a functional network, but it lacks organization, especially in an office environment where you don't want cables running across the floor.

#### **The Problem:**
- **Cable Management:**
  - Having loose cables running across floors poses risks, such as tripping hazards and potential damage to the cables. To avoid this, structured cabling systems are used to organize and manage network cabling effectively.

#### **Structured Cabling System:**
- **Overview:**
  - A structured cabling system consists of three main components:
    1. **Telecommunications Closet or Equipment Room:** 
       - Houses the central networking equipment like switches and routers.
    2. **Horizontal Cabling:**
       - The cabling that runs from the equipment room to various work areas in the office. This cabling is typically hidden within walls or ceilings and should remain undisturbed once installed.
    3. **Work Areas:**
       - The locations where computers and other networked devices are connected, typically through wall outlets.

- **Key Components:**
  - **19-Inch Equipment Rack:**
    - This rack holds the networking equipment, including the switches and patch panels.
  - **Patch Panel:**
    - A patch panel serves as the termination point for horizontal cabling. The cables from different areas of the office are punched down into the back of the patch panel, and then patch cables are used to connect the patch panel to the switch.
  - **Patch Cables:**
    - These are flexible, stranded-core cables that connect devices to the network. They are used both in the equipment room to connect the patch panel to the switch and in the work areas to connect wall outlets to individual computers.

#### **Importance of Standards:**
- **EIA/TIA Standards (Now Simply TIA):**
  - These standards define how structured cabling systems should be designed and implemented. They cover everything from wiring individual connections to determining how many wall outlets should be installed per linear foot of wall.
  - **EIA/TIA 568A and 568B:**
    - These are the two main wiring standards for Ethernet cables, defining the color coding and pin assignments for connectors.

#### **Practical Application:**
- **Equipment Room:**
  - The equipment room or telecommunications closet is the central hub of the network. All horizontal cabling from different areas of the office converges here and is terminated on the patch panel.
  - Patch cables are then used to connect the patch panel to the switch, allowing for easy reconfiguration without disturbing the horizontal cabling hidden within the walls.

- **Work Areas:**
  - In each work area, patch cables connect devices to the network via wall outlets. These wall outlets are connected to the patch panel in the equipment room through the horizontal cabling.

This structured cabling approach not only makes the network more organized but also ensures that changes can be made easily without disturbing the critical cabling infrastructure. Understanding this system and the standards that guide its implementation is essential for anyone involved in network installation and maintenance.
## Terminating Structured Cabling
#### **Introduction to 110 Punch Downs:**
In the networking world, while RJ-45 crimps are commonly used for patch cables, the majority of connections in structured cabling systems use a different type of connector known as a 110 punch down. This method is essential for establishing reliable and organized network connections.

#### **Patch Panel Setup:**
- **Patch Panel Overview:**
  - The patch panel is a crucial component in a structured cabling system. It is where the horizontal cabling from different locations in an office or building is terminated.
  - A typical patch panel, like the 24-port one shown here, has 110 punch downs on the back, corresponding to each of the RJ-45 connectors on the front.

- **Cat Rating:**
  - Just like cables, patch panels have a Cat rating (e.g., Cat 5e, Cat 6) that indicates the level of performance and speed the panel can support. It’s important to ensure that the Cat rating of the patch panel matches the rating of the cables and other components used in the network.

#### **Punching Down Cables:**
- **Tools and Preparation:**
  - The main tool used for this process is the 110 punch down tool. This tool is designed to insert the wires into the slots on the patch panel while cutting off any excess wire.
  - Before using the tool, it’s important to lay out the wires according to the TIA/EIA 568A or 568B color codes. For this example, the 568B standard is used.

- **Punch Down Process:**
  - Start by placing the wires in the appropriate slots on the patch panel, aligning them with the color code.
  - The 110 punch down tool has a sharp edge that should be oriented to cut the wire while punching it down into the slot.
  - After aligning the wire, punch it down with the tool, which simultaneously secures the wire and cuts off the excess.

#### **Wall Outlet Setup:**
- **RJ-45 Wall Jack:**
  - The other end of the horizontal cable run connects to an RJ-45 jack that will be installed in a wall outlet near the user’s computer or device.
  - Similar to the patch panel, the jack has 110 punch downs, and the wires must be arranged according to the TIA/EIA 568A or 568B standard.

- **Punching Down the Wall Jack:**
  - Carefully insert the wires into the appropriate slots, ensuring minimal untwisting to maintain signal integrity, especially for higher Cat ratings.
  - Use the 110 punch down tool to secure the wires in the jack, just as you did with the patch panel.

- **Final Assembly:**
  - Once the wires are punched down, the jack is ready to be placed into a wall plate, completing the setup for that horizontal run.

#### **Final Notes:**
- **Professional Standards:**
  - While the process demonstrated here covers the basics, professional cable installers typically work much faster and with more precision, particularly in minimizing wire untwisting to adhere strictly to industry standards.
  
- **Applications:**
  - This setup is used in structured cabling systems where network reliability and organization are critical, such as in office buildings, data centers, and large facilities.

Understanding and correctly implementing 110 punch downs is essential for anyone involved in setting up or maintaining structured cabling systems, ensuring efficient and reliable network connectivity.
## Equipment Room

**Introduction to the Equipment Room:**
- The equipment room is the central hub in a structured cabling system. It houses the essential networking components that connect and manage all the devices in the network.
- In a smaller network setup, like the one at Total Seminars, the equipment room may contain a single 19-inch rack that holds various pieces of networking equipment.

**Main Distribution Frame (MDF) vs. Intermediate Distribution Frame (IDF):**
- **Main Distribution Frame (MDF):** 
  - The MDF is the primary hub where all network connections converge. It’s where all the horizontal cabling from various parts of the building terminates and connects to external networks.
  - In smaller networks, the MDF may be the only equipment room. However, in larger buildings or campuses, the MDF connects to Intermediate Distribution Frames (IDFs) located on different floors or sections of the building.

- **Intermediate Distribution Frame (IDF):**
  - IDFs serve as intermediary hubs, connecting to the MDF and extending the network to different floors or sections. 
  - While the MDF handles the main connectivity, the IDFs manage the distribution of the network across different areas.

**Components of the Equipment Rack:**
- **Patch Panel:**
  - The patch panel is where the horizontal cabling from various parts of the building terminates. These cables are punched down into the back of the patch panel, which then connects to the network switch via patch cables.
  - The patch panel allows for easy management and reconfiguration of network connections without disturbing the horizontal cabling.

- **Cable Management:**
  - Cable management systems, such as the one shown in the equipment room, help organize and secure patch cables. This keeps the setup neat and prevents cables from becoming tangled or creating hazards.

- **Switches:**
  - The network switch is the central device that connects all the devices on the network. It manages the traffic between devices and ensures that data is sent to the correct destination.
  - The equipment room may house one or multiple switches, depending on the size and complexity of the network.

- **Routers:**
  - The router connects the local network to external networks, such as the internet. In this setup, the router is still under development but is an essential component for managing external connections.

**Understanding U (Rack Unit):**
- **Rack Unit (U):**
  - Equipment racks are standardized at 19 inches wide, and the height of the equipment is measured in rack units, or U. 
  - One U is equivalent to 1.75 inches in height. This standardization ensures that all equipment fits uniformly in the rack.
  - Different pieces of equipment, such as switches, cable management units, and servers, are measured in U’s to ensure they fit correctly in the rack.

**Servers in the Equipment Rack:**
- **1U Servers:**
  - These are compact servers that fit within a 1U height in the rack. They are often called "pizza box" servers due to their flat, rectangular shape.
  - These servers are typically used for various tasks, including development, testing, or hosting specific applications.

- **5U Servers:**
  - Larger servers, like the 5U server in the equipment room, are used for more demanding tasks, such as file storage. These servers have more storage capacity and processing power and are often the backbone of the network’s storage system.

**Understanding the Demarcation Point (Demarc):**
- **Demarcation Point (Demarc):**
  - The demarc is the point where the network infrastructure of the service provider (such as a phone or cable company) ends, and the customer's network begins. 
  - It separates the service provider's responsibility from the customer's responsibility.

- **Demarc Extension:**
  - In cases where the demarc is located far from the equipment room, a demarc extension may be used to extend the service provider’s connection to the customer’s network.
  - In this setup, the demarc extension is the coaxial cable running from the demarc to the equipment room, connecting to the cable modem and ultimately to the customer’s network.

**Conclusion:**
- Understanding the layout and components of an equipment room is crucial for setting up and maintaining a structured cabling system. 
- Key concepts such as MDF and IDF, rack unit measurements, and the distinction between demarc and demarc extension are essential for effective network management.
- This knowledge is fundamental for anyone working in networking, particularly for those preparing for the Network+ certification.
## Alternative Distribution Panels
**Introduction to Network Distribution Methods:**
- While the 110-punchdown block is the standard for distributing copper-wired networks, there are other distribution methods, both older and newer, that have been used over time.
- In this session, we’ll explore two alternative distribution systems: the older 66-punchdown block and the newer fiber distribution panel.

**The 66-Punchdown Block:**
- **Historical Context:**
  - The 66-punchdown block is one of the earliest types of patch panels used for unshielded twisted-pair (UTP) cabling, primarily designed for telephone systems rather than modern network cabling.
  - It was originally used for managing telephone lines in offices, where pairs of wires would connect individual phones to the main PBX (Private Branch Exchange) system.

- **Structure and Usage:**
  - Typically, large 25-pair cables would be punched down into the bottom of the 66-block, connecting to the PBX system.
  - Individual wires from these pairs would then be distributed to different telephones across the office.
  - Although it was primarily used for telephony, some setups creatively integrated the 66-block with more modern 110-patch panels to manage both phone and network connections using the same infrastructure.

- **Decline of the 66-Block:**
  - With the advent of Voice over IP (VoIP) technology, which allows voice communication to be carried over the same networks used for data, the need for dedicated 66-blocks has diminished significantly.

**Fiber Distribution Panels:**
- **Fiber Optic Networks:**
  - As networks transitioned to using fiber optics for higher speed and longer distance connections, a new type of distribution panel was needed to manage fiber optic cables.
  - Fiber distribution panels are specifically designed for the unique needs of fiber optic networks, which cannot be managed with traditional 110 or 66-punchdown blocks.

- **Structure and Function:**
  - A fiber distribution panel typically contains multiple connections for fiber optic cables. These connections are carefully organized within the panel, with each connection corresponding to a different run of fiber optic cable.
  - The front side of the panel connects to fiber optic switches, while the back side would connect to other network distribution points, such as floors in a building or separate wings in a facility.

- **Usage in Modern Networks:**
  - Fiber distribution panels are essential for managing the complex infrastructure of fiber optic networks, allowing for the isolation and organization of fiber connections in a centralized location.
  - These panels operate similarly to a 110-punchdown block but are specifically designed to handle the unique properties of fiber optics, such as light transmission and the need for precise connections.

**Conclusion:**
- **Evolution of Distribution Methods:**
  - The transition from 66-blocks to 110-punchdown blocks and finally to fiber distribution panels reflects the evolution of networking technology from basic telephone systems to high-speed data networks.
  - Each method serves or served a specific purpose in the management and organization of network cabling, adapting to the changing needs of communication technology.

- **Relevance to Modern Networking:**
  - While 66-punchdown blocks are largely obsolete, understanding their role provides valuable historical context for network professionals.
  - Fiber distribution panels, on the other hand, are crucial for modern networks that rely on fiber optic technology for high-speed, long-distance communication.

- **Key Takeaways:**
  - The importance of choosing the right distribution method based on the type of cabling and network needs.
  - The ongoing relevance of structured cabling principles in organizing and managing complex network infrastructures.
## Testing Cable

**Introduction to Network Testing:**
- After setting up a structured cabling system, it’s crucial to ensure that everything is functioning correctly. Testing the network cabling is an essential step to verify that each run is properly installed and meets required standards.
- To do this, network testers are used, which vary in complexity and price. Simple testers might cost around $50, while advanced testers with more features can cost hundreds or even thousands of dollars.

**Types of Network Testing:**

1. **Wiremap Testing:**
   - **Purpose:** Ensures that all the wires within a cable are correctly terminated at both ends.
   - **Process:**
     - The tester checks if each pin on one end of the cable is connected to the correct pin on the other end.
     - A basic tester will show green lights for correctly terminated pins, while errors will show as missing or crossed connections.
   - **Example:**
     - A perfect wiremap will light up all pins correctly. A faulty wiremap might show pins not lighting up, indicating missing connections or miswiring.

2. **Continuity Testing:**
   - **Purpose:** Verifies that there is an uninterrupted connection between each wire in the cable, ensuring that the signal can pass through.
   - **Process:**
     - The tester checks if there is a complete electrical path from one end of the cable to the other.
     - In cases where there is no continuity, the tester will show which wires are not connected.
   - **Example:**
     - Using an advanced tester like the Fluke MicroScanner, you can visually see which pins have continuity and which do not. A failed continuity test might show that certain pins are not connected, indicating a break in the cable.

3. **Distance Testing (TDR - Time Domain Reflectometer):**
   - **Purpose:** Measures the length of the cable to ensure it meets the required specifications, typically no more than 90 meters for horizontal cabling.
   - **Process:**
     - The tester uses TDR to send a signal down the cable and measures how long it takes for the signal to reflect back, calculating the length.
     - This test is essential for ensuring that the cable length is within the allowable range, considering the standard 100-meter limit for Ethernet, which includes patch cables.
   - **Example:**
     - The tester displays the cable length, ensuring it’s under the 90-meter limit specified by EIA/TIA 568 standards for horizontal cabling.

**Advanced Testing Considerations:**
- **Crosstalk Testing:**
  - **Purpose:** Ensures that there is minimal interference between pairs of wires in the cable, which could affect performance.
  - **Process:**
    - Professional-grade testers measure crosstalk in decibels (dB) to ensure the cable can handle the intended network speed (e.g., 10Gbps for Cat6A cables).
    - **Near-end Crosstalk (NEXT)** and **Far-end Crosstalk (FEXT)** are specific measurements that indicate how much interference occurs within the cable.
  - **Example:**
    - Cable installers use high-end testers to generate reports that certify the cable installation meets the required specifications, showing acceptable crosstalk levels.

**Conclusion:**
- **Testing Essentials:**
  - Proper network installation requires thorough testing for wiremap, continuity, and distance to ensure each run is correctly installed.
  - While basic testers can handle most day-to-day checks, professional cable installers use advanced equipment to certify that the installation meets all required standards, including crosstalk levels.
- **Certification and Verification:**
  - For network administrators, understanding these tests allows you to verify that the installation is done correctly and that the network will perform as expected. For professional installations, always review the certification report provided by the installer to confirm the network meets all performance criteria.
## Troubleshooting Structured Cabling, Part 1

When the network goes down, the first instinct might be to dive into the complex world of switches, patch panels, and routers in the equipment room. However, often the problem lies in a much simpler and more accessible place: the work area. Here’s how to troubleshoot issues starting from the user's location:

**1. Check the Basics:**
- **No Internet Connection:**
  - If your system shows no internet connection, start by checking the status in the **Network and Sharing Center** in Windows.
  - Navigate to the **Control Panel**, search for "Network and Sharing Center," and verify if any networks are listed under active networks. If it says "Not connected to any networks," there's likely a physical connectivity issue.

**2. Verify Physical Connectivity:**
- **Link Light Indicators:**
  - Check the link lights on the network card and the switch. 
  - A **solid light** typically indicates that the physical connection is good, while a **blinking light** shows that there is network activity. 
  - If there is **no light** at all, this could indicate a problem with the patch cable, the network card, or the switch port.

**3. Inspect the Network Adapter:**
- **Device Manager Check:**
  - Open **Device Manager** and verify that the network adapter is enabled. 
  - If it’s disabled, you’ll see a **down arrow** next to the Ethernet adapter. Right-click and enable it if necessary.

**4. Use the Loopback Address:**
- **Loopback Testing:**
  - The **loopback address (127.0.0.1)** is used to test the functionality of the network card.
  - Although not commonly used today, it's still important to know for the CompTIA Network+ exam.
  - To test, open the command prompt and type `ping 127.0.0.1`. A successful ping indicates that the network card is functioning properly.

**5. Consider Environmental and Physical Factors:**
- **Environmental Hazards:**
  - Patch cables that are not properly managed can be damaged by vacuum cleaners, foot traffic, or cleaning crews. 
  - Frayed cables or loose connections can be the source of the problem.
  
- **Wall Plate Connections:**
  - Sometimes, cables can be damaged where they connect to the wall plate due to being yanked or moved.
  - If damaged, you may need to replace the RJ45 connector and punch it down into the wall plate properly.

**6. Conclusion: Start with the Work Area:**
- Always start troubleshooting in the work area before moving on to the more complex equipment in the network closet.
- This approach avoids unnecessary disruptions to the network and ensures that simple issues, like a bad patch cable or a loose connection, are addressed first.

By following these steps, you can efficiently identify and resolve common network issues in the work area, preventing the need for more invasive troubleshooting that could cause additional problems.
## Troubleshooting Structured Cabling, Part 2

While most network problems often arise in the work area, there are times when issues originate from the equipment room. Understanding how to troubleshoot in this area is crucial, especially when a problem affects multiple users at once. Here’s how to approach troubleshooting in the equipment room:

**1. Identifying the Scope of the Problem:**
- **All Users vs. Individual Users:**
  - **Network+ Alert:** If **all users** connected to a particular switch go down, the issue is likely with that switch or something upstream. If only an **individual user** is down, the problem is likely isolated to their connection or workstation. Pay attention to this distinction when diagnosing problems and during exams.

**2. Electrical Issues:**
- **Multimeter Usage:**
  - A **multimeter** is essential for checking the voltages in your equipment room, both AC and DC. It can help you detect dips or irregularities in voltage that could be affecting your network equipment.
  
- **Voltage Monitor:**
  - A **voltage monitor** records voltage levels continuously, logging any dips or spikes that occur, even during off-hours like 3:00 AM. This tool is more advanced and expensive but provides ongoing monitoring that can alert you to power issues.

- **Rack-Mounted UPS:**
  - Protect your equipment with a **rack-mounted UPS** (Uninterruptible Power Supply). This device ensures that your network stays up and running during power outages or fluctuations, giving you time to address the issue without immediate downtime.

**3. Horizontal Cabling Issues:**
- **Using a TDR (Time Domain Reflectometer):**
  - A **TDR** helps identify breaks or faults in your horizontal cabling. By measuring the length of the cable run, you can pinpoint where the issue lies. For example, if a cable run should be 70 meters but the TDR only reads 10 meters, there's likely a break or fault 10 meters from one end.

**4. Interference Issues:**
- **Potential Interference Sources:**
  - **HVAC Systems:** New installations or equipment like HVAC systems can introduce interference into your network, even if the cabling was certified for low interference initially.
  - **Timing of Interference:** Sometimes, interference only occurs at specific times, such as when elevators are heavily used at the end of the workday. 

- **Network+ Alert:** Be alert for exam questions that mention issues occurring at specific times, such as "at 5:00 PM," which could indicate time-related interference, such as from elevators or other machinery.

**5. Conclusion:**
- **Start with the Work Area:** Before diving into the equipment room, always check the work area first, as it is more often the source of issues.
- **Be Prepared:** When you do need to troubleshoot in the equipment room, make sure you have the right tools—such as a multimeter, voltage monitor, TDR, and a rack-mounted UPS—and understand the specific problems they can help you diagnose.

By keeping these strategies in mind, you can effectively troubleshoot and resolve issues in the equipment room, ensuring minimal downtime and maintaining a reliable network.
## Using a Toner and Probe

I installed a power outlet and an RJ45 connection about a year ago, intending to hook up a network-aware projector. Now that I'm ready to install the projector, I’ve encountered a problem: I forgot where the RJ45 connection leads to in my patch panel in the equipment room.

To solve this, I'll use a **tone generator and a tone probe**, commonly known as a **Fox & Hound**. Here’s how it works:

1. **Tone Generator:** The "Fox" creates a distinct tone.
2. **Tone Probe:** The "Hound" detects the tone as you move it close to the corresponding cable.

The tone generator I’m using has an RJ11 connection, but it snaps into the RJ45 port just fine because RJ11 connectors fit into RJ45 jacks.

### Steps to Find the Correct Cable

**1. Connect the Tone Generator:**
   - I connect the tone generator to the RJ45 outlet. It starts emitting a tone.

**2. Use the Tone Probe in the Patch Panel:**
   - I head over to the patch panel in the equipment room with the tone probe in hand.
   - Before using the probe, I unplug the switch. This is crucial because active network signals can cause interference, making it harder to hear the tone.
   - I start probing the bundle of cables.

**3. Identifying the Correct Cable:**
   - As I move the probe around the cables, I listen for the tone.
   - When I get close to the right cable, the probe starts beeping louder.

**4. Labeling the Cable:**
   - Once I’ve identified the correct outlet on the patch panel, I label it as “Home Theater” to avoid repeating this process in the future.


## Wired Connection Scenarios

#### 1. Slow or Poor Connectivity Issues

**Attenuation:**
- **Definition:** Over long distances, the strength of a signal degrades, leading to attenuation.
- **Symptoms:** Poor communication and slow network performance.
- **Solution:** Ensure that cable runs are within the recommended 100-meter limit for Ethernet cables. Attenuation typically occurs due to improper cable installation or oversight during the setup process.

**Jitter:**
- **Definition:** Variation in packet arrival times, often causing disruptions in real-time communications.
- **Symptoms:** Choppy voice calls in VoIP, freezes in video streams.
- **Solution:** Increase network throughput by identifying and eliminating bottlenecks. Jitter is challenging to diagnose but can sometimes be managed by buffering or accepting slight delays.

**Incorrect Cable Type:**
- **Definition:** Using a lower-grade cable (e.g., Cat 5e) in a higher-performance network (e.g., Cat 6a).
- **Symptoms:** Network speed fluctuates, and devices may fail to maintain a stable connection.
- **Solution:** Ensure consistent use of high-grade cables throughout the network. Proper inventory management and disposal of outdated cables can prevent these issues.

#### 2. No Connectivity Issues

**Bad Ports:**
- **Definition:** A faulty port on a switch or network device.
- **Symptoms:** Devices connected to the port show no network connection.
- **Solution:** Test by plugging the cable into a different port. If one port fails, the switch may be close to failure, and replacing it might be necessary.

**Transmit and Receive Reversed:**
- **Definition:** Incorrect wiring of cables, such as using a crossover cable when a straight-through cable is needed.
- **Symptoms:** No connection or communication between devices.
- **Solution:** Use properly labeled cables and ensure correct wiring. Some switches have uplink ports that can be toggled to correct the issue.

**Bent Pins:**
- **Definition:** Physical damage to the pins inside the RJ45 connectors or ports.
- **Symptoms:** Intermittent or no connectivity.
- **Solution:** Replace the affected cable or switch. Attempting to bend the pins back is often unsuccessful and not recommended.

**Open or Short Circuits:**
- **Definition:** An open occurs when a cable wire isn't properly connected, while a short happens when wires are incorrectly touching.
- **Symptoms:** No network communication.
- **Solution:** Replace the faulty cable. Opens and shorts are typically due to poor cable installation.
