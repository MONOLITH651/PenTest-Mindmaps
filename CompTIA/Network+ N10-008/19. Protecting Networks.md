   - **Conditions:** Successful if the legitimate switch is configured to negotiate a trunk (dynamic desirable, dynamic auto, or trunk mode).
   - **Protection:** Manually configure trunk ports to prevent automatic trunk creation.

2. **Double Tagging:**
   - **Description:** Attacker modifies Ethernet frames to add two VLAN tags—an outer tag (attacker's VLAN) and an inner tag (victim's VLAN). The outer tag is stripped by the first switch, and the inner tag is used to direct the frame to the victim's VLAN.
   - **Conditions:** Requires the attacker to belong to the native VLAN of the trunk.
   - **Protection:** Avoid using the native VLAN for anything other than maintenance. Isolate VLAN1 for maintenance only.

### **Best Practices for VLAN Security**
1. **Manual Trunk Configuration:**
   - **Reason:** Prevents attackers from exploiting dynamic trunking protocols like DTP.

2. **Isolate VLAN1:**
   - **Reason:** Native VLAN should be used only for maintenance to minimize risk.

3. **Private VLANs (Port Isolation):**
   - **Description:** Controls communication between ports within the same VLAN.
   - **Types:**
     - **Community Ports:** Can communicate with each other and all ports in the VLAN.
     - **Isolated Ports:** Cannot communicate with other ports, including those within the same VLAN.

### **Practical Configuration Example:**
1. **VLAN Setup:**
   - **Configuration:** Assign VLAN1 to maintenance ports and VLAN100 to other devices. Ensure proper tagging and isolation.
   - **Demonstration:** In a practical scenario, configure VLANs on a switch, apply VLANs to specific ports, and ensure correct operation by avoiding common misconfigurations.

2. **Troubleshooting:**
   - **Issue:** Incorrect port assignments can lead to connectivity problems (e.g., being kicked off the network).
   - **Solution:** Verify VLAN assignments and port configurations to ensure proper operation.

### **Exam Preparation Tips:**
- **Understand VLAN Hopping Types:** Familiarize yourself with VLAN spoofing and double tagging.
- **Know Protection Strategies:** Be aware of manual trunk configuration and native VLAN isolation.
- **Private VLAN Knowledge:** Understand community vs. isolated ports and their use cases.

   - **Edge of Network**
     - **Purpose**: Protects the entire network from external threats.
     - **Configuration**: Often a hardware firewall or UTM box positioned between the internal network and the internet.
   
   - **Individual Hosts**
     - **Purpose**: Protects individual computers from internal and external threats.
     - **Configuration**: Installed as software on each computer, also known as a host firewall.

### 5. **Key Points to Remember**
   - **Network vs. Host-Based Firewalls**
     - **Network Firewall**: Protects entire network.
     - **Host Firewall**: Protects individual computers.
   
   - **Hardware vs. Software Firewalls**
     - **Hardware Firewall**: Dedicated physical device.
     - **Software Firewall**: Installed software on individual devices.

Understanding these categories and their functions will help clarify the role of firewalls in network security and their various implementations.
## Firewalls
Here’s a structured breakdown of the information on what firewalls do:

### 1. **Introduction to Firewall Functions**
   - **Definition**: Firewalls filter traffic based on criteria.

### 2. **Types of Firewall Filtering**
   - **Stateless Firewalling**
     - **Description**: Filters traffic based on IP address and port number.
     - **Access Control Lists (ACLs)**
       - **Function**: Define rules for allowing or blocking traffic.
       - **Example**: Creating policies to block specific games or applications.
     - **Limitations**
       - **Challenge**: Cannot handle unsolicited incoming traffic or dynamically changing port numbers effectively.

   - **Stateful Firewalling**
     - **Description**: Monitors and tracks the state of active connections.
     - **State Table**
       - **Function**: Keeps track of active connections and their states to allow or block traffic.
       - **Example**: Tracking outgoing requests to Google and allowing returning traffic.
     - **Advantages**
       - **Benefit**: More secure as it understands the context of connections.
   
   - **Application- and Context-Aware Firewalls**
     - **Description**: Inspect traffic at a deeper level, including the data payload.
     - **Deep Packet Inspection (DPI)**
       - **Function**: Analyzes data within packets to identify applications and protocols.
       - **Example**: Detecting and filtering BitTorrent traffic regardless of port number.
     - **Layer 7 Filtering**
       - **Function**: Operates at the application layer of the OSI model for more granular control.

### 3. **Firewall Configurations and Interfaces**
   - **Access Control Lists (ACLs)**
     - **Description**: Lists of rules applied to traffic filtering.
     - **Implementation**: Often configured in routers and firewall devices.
     - **Example**: Blocking specific applications or services.
   - **Firewall Appliances**
     - **Description**: Dedicated devices that perform firewall functions.
     - **Examples**: Hardware firewalls, Unified Threat Management (UTM) boxes.

### 4. **Key Points to Remember**
   - **Stateless vs. Stateful**
     - **Stateless**: Focuses on individual packets.
     - **Stateful**: Monitors entire connections.
   - **Application-Aware Firewalls**
     - **Function**: Provide advanced filtering by examining data payloads and application behavior.
