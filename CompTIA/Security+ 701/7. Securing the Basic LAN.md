## Cryptographic Methods  

##### **Introduction to Encryption**
- **Purpose:** Encryption is the science of converting readable data (plaintext) into something unreadable (ciphertext) and then back again.
- **Importance:** Encryption is fundamental to secure communications, such as texting, online shopping, and browsing the internet.

##### **Symmetric Encryption**
- **Definition:** A type of encryption where the same key is used for both encryption and decryption.
- **Challenge:** The main problem with symmetric encryption is securely sharing the key between the sender (Alice) and the receiver (Bob).
- **Session Key:** A temporary key used for a single session of communication.
  - **In-Band vs. Out-of-Band:** In-band refers to sending the key with the encrypted data, which is risky. Out-of-band refers to using a different method to share the key, such as physically delivering it.
- **Ephemeral Key:** A temporary key used only for a single session, providing what is known as perfect forward secrecy. This means that even if a previous session key is compromised, it won't affect the security of current or future sessions.

##### **Asymmetric Encryption**
- **Definition:** A type of encryption that uses a key pair â€“ a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption.
- **Key Pair:**
  - **Public Key:** Distributed openly and used to encrypt data.
  - **Private Key:** Kept secure by the owner (Alice) and used to decrypt data.
- **Process:** 
  - Alice generates a key pair and sends the public key to Bob.
  - Bob encrypts the message with Alice's public key, and only Alice can decrypt it with her private key.
  - For Bob to receive encrypted messages, he also needs to generate his own key pair and share his public key with Alice.
- **Advantages and Disadvantages:**
  - **Advantages:** Asymmetric encryption is more secure for key exchange because it avoids the need to share a single key.
  - **Disadvantages:** It is slower and requires more resources for key generation and management.

##### **Cryptosystems**
- **Definition:** A cryptosystem is a structured process that includes algorithms, keys, and protocols used to perform encryption and decryption in the IT world.
- **Purpose:** Cryptosystems define how encryption is implemented, including key sizes, communication methods, and the encryption/decryption processes on both ends (Alice and Bob).
## Symmetric Cryptosystems 
##### **Symmetric Key Algorithms**
- **Definition:** Encryption method where the same key is used to encrypt and decrypt data.
- **Example:** Encrypting a Microsoft Word document by dividing it into blocks, each block is then encrypted separately using the same key.

- **Example:** 
  - **WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access):** Uses RC4 for encryption.
  - **WPA2:** Uses AES for stronger encryption.
## Symmetric Block Modes  

##### **Introduction to Block Modes**
- **Purpose:** Enhance the security of symmetric block encryption by preventing the creation of recognizable patterns in encrypted data.
- **Context:** Standard symmetric block encryption, like Electronic Codebook (ECB), can produce patterns that may reveal information, especially with repetitive data like images or databases.

##### **Electronic Codebook (ECB)**
- **Definition:** A basic form of block encryption where identical plaintext blocks are encrypted into identical ciphertext blocks.
- **Limitation:** Vulnerable to pattern recognition, making it insecure for most applications.
- **Example:** Encrypting an image with ECB can result in visible patterns that reveal the original image structure.

##### **Cipher Block Chaining (CBC)**
- **Process:**
  - **Initialization Vector (IV):** A random value that is XORed with the first plaintext block before encryption.
  - **Chaining:** The output of each encrypted block is XORed with the next plaintext block before encryption.
- **Advantage:** Prevents identical plaintext blocks from producing identical ciphertext blocks, even with the same key.
- **Example:** CBC is commonly used in protocols like SSL/TLS for secure web communication.

##### **Cipher Feedback (CFB)**
- **Process:**
  - **Initialization Vector (IV):** Encrypted first, then XORed with the plaintext block to produce the ciphertext.
  - **Chaining:** The ciphertext output is used for encrypting the next block.
- **Advantage:** Allows encryption of small increments of plaintext, making it suitable for stream encryption.
- **Example:** CFB can be used for encrypting streaming data, like video or audio.

##### **Output Feedback (OFB)**
- **Process:**
  - **Initialization Vector (IV):** Continuously encrypted, and the output is XORed with the plaintext to produce ciphertext.
  - **Chaining:** The IV is reused for each block, maintaining synchronization between the encryption and decryption processes.
- **Advantage:** Errors do not propagate, meaning one incorrect ciphertext block does not affect the subsequent blocks.
- **Example:** OFB is useful in environments where error propagation must be minimized.

##### **Counter Mode (CTR)**
- **Process:**
  - **Nonce:** A unique value combined with an incrementing counter for each block.
  - **Encryption:** The nonce and counter combination is encrypted, and the output is XORed with the plaintext to produce ciphertext.

##### **Introduction to Alice and Bob**
- **Scenario:** Alice and Bob want to securely exchange encrypted data.
- **Challenge with Symmetric Encryption:** If Alice encrypts data using a symmetric algorithm (like AES), she needs to securely send the same key to Bob for decryption.
- **Risk:** An eavesdropper (Eve) could intercept the key during transmission, compromising the security.

#### **Asymmetric Encryption**

##### **Key Pair Concept**
- **Definition:** Asymmetric encryption uses two keys: a public key and a private key.
- **Public Key:** Distributed openly and used to encrypt data.
- **Private Key:** Kept secure and used to decrypt data encrypted with the corresponding public key.

##### **Encryption Process**
- **Public Key:** Alice generates a key pair and distributes her public key to Bob.
- **Encryption:** Bob uses Alice's public key to encrypt data and sends it back to Alice.
- **Decryption:** Alice uses her private key to decrypt the data sent by Bob.
- **Security:** Even if Eve intercepts the public key, she cannot decrypt the data without the private key.

##### **Key Exchange and Authentication**
- **Issue:** If Eve intercepts the key exchange, she could impersonate Alice or Bob.
- **Solution:** Digital signatures can be used to authenticate the keys. Alice can encrypt a small piece of data with her private key and send it along with the public key. Bob can use the public key to verify that the data was encrypted by Aliceâ€™s private key.

#### **RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) Encryption**

##### **Overview**
- **Popularity:** RSA is one of the most widely used asymmetric algorithms.
- **Core Principle:** Based on the difficulty of factoring large semi-prime numbers.
- **Key Generation:** Involves multiplying two large prime numbers to generate a semi-prime number, which is computationally infeasible to factor.

##### **Factoring and Security**
- **Example:** A small semi-prime number (e.g., 187) can be factored into its prime components (11 and 17) relatively easily.
- **Challenge:** As the semi-prime number grows, factoring becomes exponentially harder, providing security.
- **Modern RSA:** Utilizes keys that are 4096 bits long to ensure security, making them nearly impossible to factor with current technology.

##### **Limitations of RSA**

  - **Internal Mapping:** Public IPs map to internal IPs like 192.168.1.10 on port 443 and 192.168.1.11 on port 22, respectively.



## IP Security (IPsec)
##### **IPsec Authentication Methods**
- **Kerberos:** Often used in Active Directory environments for securing connections.
- **NTLMv2:** Typically used in Windows Workgroup environments.
- **PKI Certificates:** Used for mutual authentication between communicating parties.
- **Pre-shared Key (PSK):** A symmetric key shared between two endpoints for encryption and decryption.

##### **IPsec Modes**
- **Tunnel Mode:**
  - **Usage:** Commonly used in site-to-site VPNs to encrypt all traffic between two endpoints.
  - **Functionality:** The entire original packet is encapsulated within a new packet, which includes new headers with addressing information for routing over the internet. The encapsulated packet is decrypted at the endpoint, revealing the original packet.
- **Transport Mode:**
  - **Usage:** Typically used to secure communications within a local area network (LAN), for example, between client stations and a server with sensitive data.
  - **Functionality:** The original packet header remains unchanged, and the data within the packet is encrypted to protect its confidentiality.

##### **IPsec Components**
- **Authentication Header (AH):**
  - **Purpose:** Provides message integrity and authentication, ensuring the received data has not been tampered with.
  - **Functionality:** Uses hashing algorithms like HMAC-MD5 or HMAC-SHA to create a unique hash value for the packet. This hash is checked on the receiving end to confirm that the packet is authentic and has not been altered.
  - **Limitation:** Does not provide encryption or confidentiality, only authentication and integrity.
  
- **Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP):**
  - **Purpose:** Provides both integrity (through hashing) and confidentiality (through encryption) for the packet's payload.
  - **Functionality:** Encrypts the data portion of the packet, ensuring that the content remains confidential while also verifying the integrity of the data through hashing. The original packet headers (e.g., IP, TCP/UDP) remain visible, but the payload is hidden.
  - **Consideration:** While ESP secures the data within the packet, it may cause issues with firewalls that rely on reading TCP/UDP port numbers, as these are hidden.

##### **IPsec in Practice**
- **Packet Encapsulation in Tunnel Mode:**
  - **Process:** The original packet is encapsulated within a new packet, which includes new addressing headers. The packet is then sent over a secure tunnel, decrypted at the endpoint, and the original packet is revealed.
  
- **Wireshark Example - ESP Packet Capture:**
  - **Observation:** When inspecting an ESP packet in Wireshark, only the Ethernet and IP headers are visible. The payload and transport layer headers (e.g., TCP/UDP) are encrypted and hidden, making it impossible to determine the type of traffic (e.g., FTP, HTTP) without decrypting the packet.

##### **Considerations for Firewall Traversal**
- **Challenge:** Firewalls that rely on inspecting TCP/UDP port numbers may not function properly with ESP, as the port information is encrypted and hidden.
- **Solution:** When implementing IPsec with ESP, ensure that firewall configurations are considered to avoid potential issues with traffic filtering and traversal.

  - **Always On VPN:** The VPN tunnel is established as soon as the device is powered on, allowing continuous access and easier remote management.
  - **Split Tunnel:** 
    - **Enabled:** Traffic destined for the internet goes directly through the user's local network, while traffic for internal resources goes through the VPN tunnel.
    - **Disabled:** All traffic, including internet traffic, goes through the VPN tunnel and is routed through the company's network for inspection.

###### **Site-to-Site VPN**
- **Overview:** A VPN connection between two networks, typically used to link branch offices over the internet.
- **Appliance Requirements:** Both sites require a VPN appliance to establish the tunnel.
- **Traffic Routing:** Client devices on either network do not require individual VPN client software. The VPN tunnel is maintained through routing configurations.
- **Authentication Methods:** The tunnel can be authenticated using various methods such as Kerberos, PKI certificates, or pre-shared keys.
## Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS)

##### **Overview**
- **Purpose:** Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) are essential for monitoring network traffic and host activities to detect suspicious behavior. Depending on the configuration, these systems can either alert administrators or take direct action to stop potential threats.

##### **Types of Detection Systems**
- **IDS (Intrusion Detection System):**
  - **Function:** Monitors network or host activity for suspicious behavior and logs or alerts administrators without taking direct action.
- **IPS (Intrusion Prevention System):**
  - **Function:** Similar to IDS but with the added capability to take preventive measures, such as blocking traffic, when suspicious activity is detected.

##### **Network and Host-Based Systems**
- **Network-Based IDS/IPS (NIDS/NIPS):**
  - **Placement:** Typically deployed at key points in the network, such as the perimeter or within a DMZ, to monitor inbound and outbound traffic.
  - **Inline Sensors:** Placed directly in the traffic path, capable of inspecting and potentially blocking traffic in real time.
  - **Traffic Visibility:** Ensures it is placed in a way that it can see all relevant traffic, often requiring switch port mirroring for visibility.
- **Host-Based IDS/IPS (HIDS/HIPS):**
  - **Function:** Installed directly on critical servers or hosts to monitor and protect individual systems.

##### **Detection Methods**
- **Signature-Based Detection:**
  - **Function:** Uses predefined patterns or signatures of known threats to detect suspicious activity. 
  - **Example:** Detecting an nmap scan pattern, where an attacker incrementally scans all hosts and ports on a network.
- **Anomaly-Based Detection:**
  - **Function:** Establishes a baseline of normal behavior and then identifies deviations from this baseline as potential threats.

##### **Encryption and IDS/IPS**
- **Encrypted Traffic:**
  - **Challenge:** Encrypted traffic, such as that protected by IPsec or TLS, can be difficult for IDS/IPS to analyze.
  - **Decryption:** Some systems can be configured to decrypt traffic for inspection, though this can impact performance.

##### **Unified Threat Management (UTM)**
- **Definition:** A security appliance that combines multiple security features, including firewall, IDS/IPS, content filtering, anti-virus, and more, into a single solution.
- **Function:** Provides comprehensive protection by integrating various security functions into one device.

##### **Popular Open-Source IDS: Snort**
- **Overview:** Snort is a widely used open-source IDS that can be installed on both Windows and Linux systems.
- **Installation:**
  - **Command:** `sudo apt install snort` (for installing Snort on a Linux system).
- **Configuration:**
  - **Config File:** The main configuration file is located at `/etc/snort/snort.conf`.
  - **Rules File:** Custom rules can be defined in the `local.rules` file located in the same directory.
  - **Example Rule:** 
    - **Purpose:** To alert on ICMP traffic (such as ping).
    - **Rule:** `alert icmp any any -> $HOME_NET any (msg:"Testing ICMP"; sid:1000001; rev:1; classtype:icmp-event;)`
  - **Testing Configuration:** 
    - **Command:** `sudo snort -T -i eth0 -c /etc/snort/snort.conf` (used to test the configuration).
  - **Running Snort:**
    - **Command:** `sudo snort -A console -q -c /etc/snort/snort.conf` (runs Snort and outputs alerts to the console).
    - **Example Trigger:** Pinging the Snort host from a Windows machine should trigger ICMP alerts in Snort.

##### **Key Considerations**
- **Sensor Placement:** Ensure sensors are strategically placed within the network to monitor all relevant traffic.
- **Alert Handling:** Alerts should be configured to notify administrators via text, email, or integration with a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system.
- **Performance Impact:** Be mindful of the performance impact when enabling decryption of traffic for inspection.
- **Reducing False Positives:** Customize IDS/IPS configurations to reduce the occurrence of false positives by tailoring the rules to the specific network environment.
