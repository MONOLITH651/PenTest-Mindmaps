  - **Pros:** Less intrusive and typically has a lower impact on system performance.
  - **Cons:** May require more complex network setups to monitor effectively.

## Configuring Linux Log Forwarding

##### **Overview**
- **Purpose:** Syslog forwarding is crucial for centralized logging, ensuring that important log entries from various Linux hosts are sent to a centralized logging server. This is vital for maintaining a backup of logs, especially in the event of system compromise or log tampering.

##### **Configuring the Centralized Logging Host**

###### **Step 1: Modify the Syslog Configuration**
- **File:** `/etc/rsyslog.conf`
- **Action:** Use the `nano` text editor to edit the configuration file.
- **Command:** `sudo nano /etc/rsyslog.conf`
- **Details:** Uncomment the lines related to UDP connectivity by removing the hashtag symbol from the following lines:
  - `module(load="imudp")`
  - `input(type="imudp" port="514")`
- **Purpose:** This enables the centralized logging host to listen for incoming log entries on UDP port 514.

###### **Step 2: Restart the Syslog Service**
- **Command:** `sudo service rsyslog restart`
- **Purpose:** The syslog service reads its configuration from the edited file, so restarting the service applies the changes.

###### **Step 3: Verify the Service Status**
- **Command:** `sudo service rsyslog status`
- **Purpose:** Ensure that the syslog service is running without errors. Look for active status and check for any error messages.

###### **Step 4: Verify the UDP Listener**
- **Command:** `sudo netstat -nu | grep rsyslog`
- **Purpose:** Confirm that the system is listening on UDP port 514, indicating that it is ready to receive log entries from other hosts.

###### **Step 5: Note the Centralized Host IP Address**
- **Command:** `ifconfig`
- **Purpose:** Identify the IP address of the centralized logging host (e.g., `10.1.1.5`) for configuring client hosts to forward their logs to this address.

##### **Configuring the Log Client Host**

###### **Step 1: Modify the Syslog Configuration**
- **File:** `/etc/rsyslog.conf`
- **Action:** Edit the syslog configuration file on the client host.
- **Command:** `sudo nano /etc/rsyslog.conf`
- **Details:** Add a directive at the bottom of the file to forward all log entries to the centralized logging host:
  - `*.* @10.1.1.5`
- **Explanation:** The `*.*` wildcard sends all log entries, and `@10.1.1.5` specifies the IP address of the centralized logging host.

###### **Step 2: Restart the Syslog Service**
- **Command:** `sudo service rsyslog restart`
- **Purpose:** Restarting the service applies the new configuration, enabling log forwarding.

###### **Step 3: Verify the Service Status**
- **Command:** `sudo service rsyslog status`
- **Purpose:** Check the status of the syslog service to ensure it’s running correctly and that there are no configuration errors.

##### **Testing Log Forwarding**

###### **Step 1: Create a Custom Log Entry on the Client**
- **Command:** `logger "Dan testing log forwarding"`
- **Purpose:** Use the `logger` command to create a custom log entry on the client host.

###### **Step 2: Verify the Log Entry on the Client**
- **Command:** `tail /var/log/syslog`
- **Purpose:** Confirm that the custom log entry appears in the client’s syslog.

###### **Step 3: Verify the Log Entry on the Centralized Host**
- **Command:** `tail /var/log/syslog`
- **Purpose:** Check the centralized logging host’s syslog to ensure the log entry from the client host has been successfully forwarded.
