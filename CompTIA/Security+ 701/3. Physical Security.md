# Physical Security
## Physical Security  
#### **Importance of Physical Security in Cybersecurity**

##### **Hardware and Physical Access**
- **On-Premises vs. Cloud**:
  - Hardware under your control (e.g., in your home, on your network, in your data center).
  - Physical hardware in a cloud provider’s data center, where security is their responsibility.
- **Physical Access Risks**:
  - **Local Physical Access**: Malicious actors gaining physical access to devices like storage disks or laptops.
  - **Remote Network Access**: Compromising data over a network.

##### **Data Encryption**
- **Encrypting Data at Rest**:
  - On-premises.
  - In the cloud.
  - On mobile devices.

#### **Physical Security Threats and Mitigations**

##### **Unauthorized Access**
- **Keylogger Devices**:
  - **Example**: Hardware keylogger with a USB connector.
  - **Functionality**: Captures everything typed into the USB keyboard, potentially including masked passwords.
  - **Mitigation**: Use password managers like LastPass, which populate password information without using the keyboard.

- **Visitor Management**:
  - **Visitor Logs**: Track entry and exit in a facility.
  - **Reception Areas**: Risks when no one is present at the front desk, allowing attackers to plug devices into the network.

##### **Facility Security**
- **Security Guards**:
  - **Role**: Ensure only authorized personnel have access to the facility.
  - **ID Badges**: Required for entry and monitored by security personnel.

- **Robot Sentries**:
  - **Types**: 
    - Terrestrial-based robots with built-in cameras and Wi-Fi.
    - Aerial-based drones.
  - **Functionality**: Act as robot security guards, monitoring properties.
#### **Location and Structural Security**

##### **Surveillance and Monitoring**
- **Security Cameras**:
  - **Purpose**: Record and monitor access to secure areas like server rooms.
- **Mantraps (Access Control Vestibules)**:
  - **Function**: Inner door opens only when the outer door is securely closed to prevent tailgating.

#### **Data and Equipment Protection**

##### **Fire Suppression and Backup Security**
- **Fire Suppression**:
  - **Class C**: Specifically for electrical fires in server rooms.
- **Locked Equipment Racks**:
  - **Purpose**: Protect sensitive equipment like storage arrays and servers.
- **On-Premises Safes**:
  - **Usage**: Secure storage for backup tapes, with the recommendation to also use cloud backups.

##### **Air-Gapped Networks**
- **Definition**: Isolated networks with no physical or wireless connections to other networks.
- **Examples**:
  - **High-Security Environments**: Research facilities, military installations, and law enforcement.
  - **Risks**: Possible compromise via infected USB drives or infected laptops brought onto the network.
## Keylogger Demo  

##### **Physical Access Risks**
- **Unauthorized Access**
  - **Example**: Attacker gaining physical access to a desktop computer.
  - **Risk**: Easy insertion of a hardware keylogger in a few seconds.

##### **Relation to Cybersecurity**
- **Impact on Digital Assets**
  - **Physical Control**: Critical for protecting digital assets.
  - **Virus Scanners**: Ineffective against hardware-level threats.
#### **Hardware Keylogger Configuration**

##### **Setup and Operation**
- **Keylogger Components**
  - **USB Keyboard**: Plugs into the hardware keylogger.
  - **Keylogger**: Plugs into the USB port of a desktop computer.
  - **Wi-Fi Access Point**: Embedded in the keylogger, activates upon receiving power.

##### **Demonstration**
- **Typing Example**
  - **Input**: Typing characters "a, b, c, d, e, f, g".
  - **Capture**: Keylogger retains the keystrokes automatically.
#### **Accessing Keylogger Data**

##### **Connecting to the Keylogger’s Wi-Fi**
- **Steps to Connect**
  - **Open Wi-Fi Settings**: In Windows, search for available networks.
  - **Select Network**: Identify and connect to the keylogger’s Wi-Fi network (e.g., "air 0844 BC").
  - **No Internet Required**: Connection is local, without needing internet access.

##### **Viewing Captured Keystrokes**
- **Accessing the Web Page**
  - **Use Browser**: Enter the IP address of the default gateway in the web browser.
  - **View Data**: Examine the web page to see the captured keystrokes, including the typed characters.

#### **Security Implications**

##### **Importance of Awareness**
- **Physical Security Measures**
  - **Controlled Access**: Essential to prevent unauthorized physical access to devices.
  - **Reception Areas**: Need for vigilance in public spaces to prevent easy attacks.

##### **Protecting Digital Assets**
- **Urgency**
  - **Risk of Easy Exploitation**: Demonstrated ease of capturing sensitive data underscores the need for robust physical security measures.
## Environmental Controls
#### **Importance of Physical and Environmental Security**

##### **Physical Security's Impact on Digital Security**
- **Digital Assets Protection**
  - **Importance**: Physical security safeguards digital assets and data stored on storage arrays.
  - **Threats**: Unauthorized physical access can lead to significant security breaches.
