## Quantitative Risk Assessments  

##### Introduction to Quantitative Risk Assessment
- **Purpose**: To determine if the cost of implementing security controls is justified by the value of the asset being protected.
- **Focus**: Uses numeric values, often dollar amounts, to assess risk.

##### Key Concepts in Quantitative Risk Assessment

- **Asset Value (AV)**
  - Definition: The monetary value of an asset.
  - Example: A customer database valued at $50,000.

- **Exposure Factor (EF)**
  - Definition: The percentage of the asset that is considered lost when a negative incident occurs.
  - Example: An EF of 1 (100%) means total loss of the asset.

- **Single Loss Expectancy (SLE)**
  - Definition: The expected monetary loss from a single negative incident.
  - Calculation: SLE = Asset Value (AV) × Exposure Factor (EF).
  - Example: If an asset valued at $24,000 has an EF of 12.5%, the SLE is $3,000.

- **Annual Rate of Occurrence (ARO)**
  - Definition: The expected number of occurrences of a specific risk per year.
  - Example: Downtime for an e-commerce website might occur 2 or 3 times a year.

- **Annualized Loss Expectancy (ALE)**
  - Definition: The yearly expected monetary loss from a specific risk.
  - Calculation: ALE = SLE × ARO.
  - Example: If the SLE is $3,000 and the ARO is 2, the ALE is $6,000.

##### Practical Example: E-Commerce Website

- **Asset**: E-commerce website generating $24,000 per day.
- **Risk**: Downtime due to malicious attacks or hardware failures.
- **Exposure Factor Calculation**: 
  - Downtime of 3 hours out of 24 hours = 12.5% EF.
- **Single Loss Expectancy (SLE)**:
  - Calculation: $24,000 × 12.5% = $3,000 for 3 hours of downtime.
- **Annual Rate of Occurrence (ARO)**:
  - Example: Downtime occurs twice per year.
- **Annualized Loss Expectancy (ALE)**:
  - Calculation: $3,000 (SLE) × 2 (ARO) = $6,000.
  
##### Importance of Quantitative Risk Assessment

- **Comparison of Costs**:
  - Compare the ALE to the cost of security controls.
  - Example: If ALE is $6,000, it makes sense to spend $6,000 or less on security controls to protect the asset.

##### Conclusion

- **Purpose**: Quantitative risk assessment helps determine the financial justification for security controls.

## Qualitative Risk Assessments  
##### Introduction to Qualitative Risk Assessment
- **Definition**: Based on subjective opinions rather than hard numbers.
- **Focus**: Likelihood of a threat occurring, the impact on assets, and severity level ratings.
- **Subjectivity**: Different individuals might assign different severity ratings, leading to variability in assessments.

##### Components of Qualitative Risk Assessment

- **Severity Level Ratings**
  - Subjective ratings based on the perceived severity of the risk.
  - Example: High, Medium, Low.

- **Impact Level Ratings**
  - Assessment of the potential impact on assets if the threat is realized.
  - Example: High, Medium, Low.

##### Risk Register

- **Purpose**: Centralized list of risks with severity and impact ratings, responsible individuals, and mitigating controls.
- **Use Cases**: 
  - Entire organization, specific departments, or individual projects.
  - May contain qualitative data such as severity and impact ratings, with occasional dollar values.
- **Example Components**:
  - Risk number, date of entry, title, likelihood (High, Medium, Low), impact (High, Medium, Low), owner, mitigation (e.g., Incident Response Plan).

##### Risk Visualization Tools

- **Risk Heat Map**
  - **Purpose**: Visual representation of risks using color-coded blocks.
  - **Colors**: Red indicates high risk or high impact levels.
  - **Reference**: Numbers within the heat map correspond to risks listed in the risk register.

- **Risk Matrix**
  - **Purpose**: Centralized details of risks without using colors.
  - **Comparison**: Similar to a risk heat map but without color coding.

##### Comparison with Quantitative Risk Assessment

- **Quantitative Risk Assessment**: Based on hard numbers (e.g., dollar amounts).
- **Qualitative Risk Assessment**: Subjective assessment based on severity levels and impact ratings.

## Security and the Information Life Cycle  

##### Importance of Security in the Information Lifecycle
- **Goal**: Implement security at all phases to avoid costly and ineffective Band-Aid solutions later.

  - Laws and regulations protect PII to prevent identity theft and unauthorized use.
  
- **Protected Health Information (PHI)**
  - Medical information that can be traced back to an individual.
  - Examples: Health insurance numbers, blood type, medical conditions.

##### Anonymization Techniques

- **Anonymization**
  - **Purpose**: Remove or replace sensitive information to prevent it from being traced back to an individual.
  - **GDPR**: Allows anonymized data collection and use without consent.
  
- **Pseudonymization**
  - Replacing unique identifiers with non-identifiable ones while retaining other non-sensitive information.
  
- **Data Minimization**
  - Retaining only the data that is necessary and legally allowed.
  - Example: PCI DSS guidelines for handling credit card information.
  
- **Tokenization**
  - Replacing sensitive data (e.g., credit card numbers) with a unique token for secure transactions.
  - Requires trust between the tokenization service and the application using it.
  
- **Data Masking**
  - Obscuring sensitive data (e.g., masking credit card numbers on receipts or passwords during login).

##### Data Sovereignty

- **Definition**: The physical location of data and its impact on applicable laws and regulations.
- **Relevance**: Different laws may apply based on where data is stored, especially in cloud environments.
- **Example**: Microsoft Azure Cloud
  - **Geo-Replication**: Data stored in multiple locations within or across countries.

  - Importance of destroying failed hard disks that may contain sensitive information.
  - Organizational policies for end-of-life equipment (e.g., reuse, donation, destruction).

- **Digital Media Sanitization**:
  - **File Deletion**: Simple deletion allows easy recovery; even emptying the recycle bin does not prevent recovery.
  - **Disk Partitioning**: Reformatting or wiping partitions may still allow data recovery, depending on subsequent activities.

- **Disk Wiping Tools**:
  - **Purpose**: Overwrite disk sectors multiple times with randomized data to prevent recovery.
  - **Types**:
    - Tools designed for SSDs or traditional hard disk drives.
    - Examples: Hard Disk Scrubber, command-line tools, Linux-based tools.

- **Degaussing**:
  - **Technique**: Applies a strong magnetic field to hard disk drives, removing magnetism and making data inaccessible.
  - **Limitation**: Effective only for hard disk drives, not SSDs.

- **Cryptographic Erasure**:
  - **Concept**: Data becomes inaccessible by removing the cryptographic key used to encrypt the drive's contents.
  - **Application**: Useful for decommissioning encrypted storage devices like self-encrypting drives.

##### Example: Digital Data Destruction Process

- **Tool Example**: Hard Disk Scrubber
  - **Process**: Select the device, choose scrubbing type (e.g., normal, ultra nine-stage), and initiate the wipe.
  - **Consideration**: DoD-recommended multi-pass wipes ensure that no data artifacts remain.

##### Importance of Data Destruction

- **End-of-Life Data Protection**:
  - Physical destruction (e.g., shredding, pulverizing) and digital sanitization (e.g., multi-pass wipes) are crucial.
  - Cryptographic erasure as an alternative for encrypted drives.
