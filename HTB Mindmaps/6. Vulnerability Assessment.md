## Nessus
### Vulnerability Scanning Overview
**Purpose:**
- Identify potential vulnerabilities in network devices (routers, firewalls, switches), servers, workstations, and applications.
- Scanning is automated and aims to find potential/known vulnerabilities. Manual validation is often required to differentiate between real issues and false positives.

**Difference from Penetration Testing:**
- **Vulnerability Scanning:** Automated, identifies potential vulnerabilities but does not typically exploit them.
- **Penetration Testing:** Involves exploitation of vulnerabilities to assess security, providing more in-depth analysis beyond what a scan alone offers.

**Types of Scans:**
- **Static Tests:** Check if the asset's version matches known vulnerabilities (e.g., based on CVEs). May not be accurate if patches are applied or the target is not vulnerable.
- **Dynamic Tests:** Involve testing specific payloads (e.g., weak credentials, SQL injection) on the target. Indicates vulnerabilities based on the response to these tests.

**Scanning Schedule:**
- Perform both unauthenticated and authenticated scans regularly.
- Integrate vulnerability scanning into the organization’s patch management program to address new vulnerabilities and configuration issues.

**Tools:**
- **Nessus:** 
  - **Nessus Essentials:** Free version of Nessus with limited features, supports up to 16 hosts.
- **OpenVAS:**
  - Open-source vulnerability scanner capable of performing both authenticated and unauthenticated network scans.

### Scanning Issues

**1. Best Practices Before Scanning:**
- **Communication:** Discuss with clients or stakeholders about sensitive or legacy hosts that should be excluded. For high-priority or high-availability hosts, consider scanning outside business hours or with adjusted configurations to avoid disruptions.

- **Fine-Tuning Scans:** Unexpected scan results may require adjustments.

**2. Mitigating Issues:**
- **Firewall Issues:**
  - **Symptom:** Scan results show all ports open or no ports open.
  - **Fix:** Configure an Advanced Scan and disable the "Ping the remote host" option to avoid using ICMP, which may lead to false positives.

- **Rate-Limiting:** 
  - **Adjustments:** Modify Performance Options, such as Max Concurrent Checks Per Host, to minimize impact on heavily loaded hosts.

- **Legacy Systems & Sensitive Hosts:**
  - **Options:** Exclude legacy systems or printers from scans. For critical hosts, exclude them from the target scope or use the `nessusd.rules` file to configure scans.

- **Safe Checks:**
  - **Avoidance:** Never perform Denial of Service checks unless explicitly requested. Enable "safe checks" to avoid network plugins that could have negative impacts, such as crashing daemons. While this option reduces risk, it does not guarantee zero adverse impact.

- **Client/Stakeholder Communication:** Always inform and alert necessary personnel before starting scans. Maintain detailed logs for investigation if issues arise.

**3. Network Impact:**
- **Measurement:** Assess the impact of scanning on network bandwidth using `vnstat`.
  - **Installation:**      sudo apt install vnstat
  - **Pre-Scan Monitoring:**     sudo vnstat -l -i eth0
  - **Post-Scan Monitoring:**     sudo vnstat -l -i eth0
  - **Comparison:**
    - **Pre-Scan:** Low network usage.
    - **During Scan:** Significant increase in bytes and packets transferred, highlighting the potential impact on network performance.

  - **Example Results:**
    - **Pre-Scan:**       rx:       332 bit/s     0 p/s          tx:       332 bit/s     0 p/s

    - **During Scan:**       rx:   307.92 kbit/s   641 p/s          tx:   380.41 kbit/s   767 p/s

  - **Observation:** Scanning can heavily impact network performance if not managed properly.
