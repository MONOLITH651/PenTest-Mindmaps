https://hstechdocs.helpsystems.com/manuals/cobaltstrike/current/userguide/content/cobalt-4-5-user-guide.pdf
## Getting Started
- Pre-requisites 
	- Oracle Java 1.8
	- Oracle Java 11
	- OpenJDK 11
- Start the Team Server
	- must run on a supportive Linux system
	- ./teamserver ip_address password malleableC2profile kill_date
	- sudo ./teamserver 10.10.5.50 Passw0rd! c2-profiles/normal/webbug.profile
- Start the Client 
	- ./cobaltstrike-client.sh
	- cobaltstrike-client.cmd

## Listener Management
- Types
	- Egress
		- General
			- allows Beacon to communicate outside of the target network to our team server
		- HTTP 
			- listeners allows Beacon to send and receive C2 messages over HTTP GET/POST requests
		- DNS 
			- send and receive C2 messages over several lookup/response types including A, AAAA and TXT
	- P2P or Peer-to-Peer
		- General
			- they don't communicate with the team server directly
			- child SMB/TCP beacon linked to an egress HTTP/DNS beacon
			- chain multiple Beacons into parent-child relationships
			- to reduce number of hosts talking to team server - better OPSEC
			- to run Beacons on machines that can't even talk out of the network (firewall, segregations) 
		- SMB
			- will start a new named pipe server and listen for incoming traffic 
			- OPSEC | emulate names known to be used by common applications ls \\.\pipe\ to list names
		- raw TCP
			- will bind and listen on the specified port number
			- bind to only the localhost 127.0.0.1 or bind to all interfaces 0.0.0.0
