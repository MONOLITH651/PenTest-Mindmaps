# PenTest-Mindmaps
Welcome to the Pentesting Mindmaps project! This repository is dedicated to creating comprehensive and visually engaging mindmaps that cover various aspects of penetration testing. My goal is to provide a valuable resource for cybersecurity professionals, ethical hackers, and enthusiasts to enhance their knowledge and streamline their pentesting processes.

What is a Mindmap?
A mindmap is a visual representation of information that organizes and structures data in a hierarchical manner. It helps in understanding complex topics, brainstorming ideas, and connecting related concepts. In this project, I use mindmaps to illustrate the methodologies, techniques, tools, and best practices in penetration testing.
