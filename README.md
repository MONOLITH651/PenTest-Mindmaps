# PenTest-Mindmaps
Welcome to the Pentesting Mindmaps project! This repository is dedicated to creating comprehensive and visually engaging mindmaps that cover various aspects of penetration testing. Our goal is to provide a valuable resource for cybersecurity professionals, ethical hackers, and enthusiasts to enhance their knowledge and streamline their pentesting processes.
What is a Mindmap?

A mindmap is a visual representation of information that organizes and structures data in a hierarchical manner. It helps in understanding complex topics, brainstorming ideas, and connecting related concepts. In this project, we use mindmaps to illustrate the methodologies, techniques, tools, and best practices in penetration testing.
